## About
This project visualizes public opinion on affirmative action, abortion, and 
capital punishment from 1972-2022, using data from the General Social Survey (GSS).
We investigate how different groupsâ€™ opinions have shifted over time and explore 
overall trends in public opinion. 

## Data
GSS is a nationally representative survey of US adults run by the 
National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago. 
Surveys are ran every one to two years dating back to 1972, with at least 
1,500 respondents in every sample. 

We downloaded the GSS data using the R packages
[gssr and gssrdoc](https://kjhealy.github.io/gssr/), built by kjhealy.
